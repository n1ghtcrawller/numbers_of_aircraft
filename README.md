<h1>Hello everyone, I'm n1ghtcrawller.</h1>
<h2>In recent weeks, I have been working on a software called NOAC, which helps
Civil Aviation operators and engineers to correctly and structurally record and
store data on aircraft applicability</h2>


<h3>1. The program is under development and may not work correctly. We hope that you understand that at this stage we are continuing to work on improving the functionality of the program and correcting possible errors.</h3>
<h3>2. The data is stored in the GUI table, which are taken from the new.json file. This makes it easy to display and edit the table inside the program.</h3>
<h3>3. When entering the data "cirID", "Evaluate" and "resolve", they are written to objects_file.json for further processing. This data is used to calculate ranges and display the results in a table.</h3>
<h3>4. In the file calculator_numbers.py algorithms for recalculation of ranges taken from objects_file are prescribed.json (i.e. received numbers) and writing them to new.json. This file contains the main logic of the program and is an important part of its operation.</h3>
<h3>5. From new.json data is transmitted to the table, by columns and rows, depending on their number. We try to make the data display in the table as convenient and understandable as possible.<</h3>>
<h3>6. Also at this stage there are options for editing the table, deleting elements, searching for certain ranges. This allows the user to manage the data more flexibly and customize their display.</h3>
<h3>7. For the program to work correctly, you need to install the PyQt5 library. Installation instructions can be found in the documentation. We try to provide the simplest and most understandable installation of the library for all users.</h3>
<h3>8. If you have any problems with the program, please refer to the file [README.md ](http://readme.md /), where possible solutions to the problems are indicated. We try to provide as much information as possible to solve possible problems.</h3>
<h3>9. In the future, it is planned to add the ability to save the table to a file, as well as improve the algorithms for recalculating ranges. We will continue to work on improving the functionality of the program and adding new features.</h3>
